## Validation Results Summary

**Overall Status**: ✅ **PASSED**

All quality criteria have been met. The specification is complete, testable, and ready for the planning phase.

### Passing Items (12/12)
- Specification contains no implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- Written for business stakeholders with clear user value
- All mandatory sections completed: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers
- All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- 6 measurable success criteria with clear metrics
- 3 prioritized user stories (P1, P2) with acceptance scenarios
- 5 edge cases identified and documented
- Clear scope boundaries with assumptions documented
